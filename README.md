# Pittsburgh Transit on Fitbit
Transit-like app for Fitbit

Select favorite bus stops and routes on the companion page. If location permission is available, Fitbit watch app will list stops by proximity and time of next bus.

Adapted from Fitbit OS tutorial: https://github.com/Fitbit/sdk-bart

BusTime Port Authority API: http://realtime.portauthority.org/bustime/apidoc/docs/DeveloperAPIGuide3_0.pdf
