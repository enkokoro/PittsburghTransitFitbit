BusTime Port Authority API http://realtime.portauthority.org/bustime/apidoc/docs/DeveloperAPIGuide3_0.pdf

Currently only supports limited number of stops and routes. 

Future plans to include:
- support for selecting different default stops and default routes
- stop selection by GPS (nearest default stop)
