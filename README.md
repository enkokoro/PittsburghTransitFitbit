# Pittsburgh Transit on Fitbit
Transit-like app for Fitbit

Adapted from https://github.com/Fitbit/sdk-bart

Currently only supports limited number of stops and routes. 

Future plans to include:
- support for selecting different default stops and default routes
- stop selection by GPS (nearest default stop)
